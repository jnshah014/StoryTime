# StoryTime
**Latest Version:** 0.6.0

## 1) Introduction
The StoryTime application makes use of Python's `openai` module in order to generate exciting text-based adventures for the user to navigate through as well as images relating to the events in the story. Parts of the story's structure is generated using the `text-davinci-003` API, and all of the images are generated via the `dall-e 2` API architecture.

The goal of this project was to use generative AI to enterain and engage the user. Do note that the arbitrary and unrefined state of generative AI at this point in time does mean that some outputs can be undesireable - I do admit this. However, even though generative AI is in its infancy, I have optimised prompts to generate the best results.

## 2) Getting Started
