# StoryTime
**Latest Version:** 0.5.0

## 1) Introduction
The StoryTime application makes use of python's `openai` module in order to generate exciting text-based adventures for the user to navigate through as well as images relating to the events in the story. Most of the text and story's structure is set, whilst some is generated using the `text-davinci-003` API, and all of the images are generated via the `dall-e 2` API architecture.
